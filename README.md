# Hi I'm George (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent university graduate, aiming to jumpstart a career in tech. I have a passion for technology, love problem solving and really enjoy inspiring children to get into coding. 

## Experience

In the summers of 2020 and 2021 I helped design, devolop and implement, automated and interactive maths questions for students in UCLs' mathematics department to allow for the ability of online and hybrid learning. Using Maxima, LaTeX, and HTML.
